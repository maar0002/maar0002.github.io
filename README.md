This is my portfolio page. I hope to add more content as i progress.

I need to learn more about javascript for cooler designs. I was able to develop a good enough looking website by combining bootstrap and css.

However there is still more to explore and learn. 

Thank you to Bootstrap for being easy to use. All content on the page are created and owned by me.
